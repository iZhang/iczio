        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror"> Black Mirror </a> kicked off its third season with the episode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive"> Nosedive </a>. The episode explores a society where people rank one another on a five star system after just about every interaction. Part of Brooker's brilliance is that the technology discussed seems to be just around the corner -- the themes are grounded in today's smartphones and Yelp-like apps, but the implementation remains clearly out of reach for any government or corporation to roll out by next quarter.

        Imagine, then, the surprising news late last year that China is on the verge of rolling out its own <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34592186"> social credit rating </a>. While still lacking clarity, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-tool-for-social-control-a-credit-rating-for-everything-1480351590"> some </a> have reported the system will utilize "social activity" in addition to standard financial history. That means posts on the blogosphere, traffic violations, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety"> filial piety </a> could impact your ability to travel outside of the country, mortgage rates, and even which schools your kids can attend.
      </p>

      <p>
        To those of us raised in the West, the concept of a social credit rating is terrifying: it goes against fundamental values of privacy, accountability, fairness, and individuality. Unpopular opinion: I think it is a fair solution to the current state of affairs in China.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other folks have written about this in greater depth and with more expertise, so I won't rehash here. I'll simply state:

        <ol>
          <li> Chinese society operates on a system of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-most-misunderstood-business-concept-in-china-2011-2"> relations </a> that leads to strong <a href="http://www.china-mike.com/chinese-culture/understanding-chinese-mind/in-out-groups/"> in/out groups </a>. </li>
          <li> Chinese society has lost its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/22/china-nation-cold-hearts"> moral compass </a> since the country was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Nixon_visit_to_China"> opened </a>: <a href="http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2008/09/milk-scandal-engenders-moral-commentary/"> yummy tainted milk </a> and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=82651"> corruption </a> </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        Essentially, the immense focus on economic growth in the 80s and 90s in a society with a strong in/out group mentality led to the pursuit of $$$ over empathy for others, especially in business dealings, for the past two decades. 
      </p>

      <p>
        So why do I like the social credit rating? Well, in a relational-network society, what better way to promote morally principled action than to make your citizens feel like everyone is a part of their network? The end consumers of your baby milk are no longer nameless strangers and faces that are "out" of your network, they are now feedback mechanisms of your credit rating that will determine where your kids go to school. The people who read your blog are not just mindless drones in the ether, they are people who have been influenced, for better or worse, by you. A system like this forces an expansion of the standard Chinese network to encompass much more than the immediate circle of family and friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, the obvious criticism here is that the government gets to decide what "morally principled action" means for all 1.4 billion people. And that's likely to include dings to your rating based on negative comments around socialism, communism, and anything else deemed as destablizing. Only time will tell if Chinese citizens actually accept the system. In the meantime, I think it's a nuanced and efficient way to hold citizens that have lost a fundamental sense of empathy accountable for their actions.

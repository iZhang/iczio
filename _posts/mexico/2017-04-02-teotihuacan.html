      <p> I learned a lot of lessons in Mexico City after an impromptu weekend trip. I'll dish just the highlights here: 
        <ol>
          <li> There's levels to this domicile life. Upon check-in to our hotel, we were upgraded to a 2-floor apartment. This place was so large we had a servant's entrance to the full kitchen. Every morning we had, in the words of my friend Max, a literal orchard delivered fresh to our room. I need to raise my level. </li>
          <li> There's levels to this food life. <a href="http://www.pujol.com.mx/en/">Pujol</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_gastronomy"> molecular gastronomy </a> spot led by Chef's Table featured Enrique Olvera, called to inform us they had a 6-seater cancel that night at 8 pm, and if we could get there it was ours. We called that morning at 11 am. For reference, if you tried to book today, you wouldn't get a table until March. We hightailed it from the D Tap Room in Roma back to Polanco for baby corn dusted with mayo and ants, three year aged mole, and ascendance to heaven. I need to raise my what-i-put-in-my-mouf life. </li>
          <li> There's level to this movement life. We drunkenly stumbled into Mama Rumba with no preparation. I need to raise my rhythm life. </li>
        </ol>
